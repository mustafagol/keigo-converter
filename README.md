# Japanese to Keigo Converter

A simple web application that converts Japanese sentences into Keigo (honorific language). This project uses the OpenAI API for translation and is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with Docker.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a web-based Japanese to Keigo converter using the OpenAI API and deploy it on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Docker.

## Steps Completed

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**: Ensure you have the necessary tools and technologies installed, such as Python, Docker, and AWS CLI.

2. **Sign Up for OpenAI API**: Obtain your API key from the OpenAI platform to access their language model.

3. **Create Your Project Directory**: Organize your project files, including Dockerfile, requirements.txt, app.py, and templates directory.

4. **Develop the Conversion Logic**: Implement the conversion logic using the OpenAI API in the `app.py` script.

5. **Create HTML Template**: Design a basic HTML form in `templates/index.html` for user input and output display.

## Next Steps

6. **Dockerize Your Application**: Complete the Dockerfile to package your application and its dependencies into a Docker container.

7. **Deploy on AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Utilize AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy your Dockerized application, making it accessible online.

8. **Custom Domain and HTTPS (Optional)**: Configure a custom domain and enable HTTPS for enhanced security and accessibility.

9. **Scaling and Monitoring**: Set up auto-scaling and monitoring for your deployed application.

10. **Continuous Deployment (Optional)**: Implement a continuous deployment pipeline to automate updates.
